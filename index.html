											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello, I'm Tiffany, a biologist turned programmer with a passion for using technology to make a positive impact. I graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Biology in 2022, where I discovered my love for programming while using Python and R to analyze data sets in my courses. It was during an entrepreneurship course that I truly realized the power of programming as a tool for social impact. My team envisioned a social network promoting sustainability, and I was inspired by how technology could drive meaningful change.</p>

										<p>After graduating, I made the decision to take a gap year to explore my newfound interests and values. From my early days of writing code to customize my blog in middle school, to my experiences in college where I witnessed the transformative power of programming languages, I am thrilled to embark on a career in programming.</p>
											
										<p>Python has been my primary programming language, and I continue to expand my knowledge through self-teaching and daily learning. Beyond programming, I find joy and creative expression as a fiber artist and guitarist. Ultimately, my goal is to combine technology and the arts to foster connection and bring happiness to others.</p>
											
										<p>I am excited to contribute my skills, creativity, and dedication to developing innovative solutions that make a difference. Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!</p>
